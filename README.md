# Project Title

Hello everyone! ReallyBooky is a personal project of mine, it's a book-reading platform with a lot of features that I used in my smaller projects. 

## Description

I am a huge bookworm and a simple book generator was the first thing I've ever built. It wasn't even for myself, it was for my fiancee because they had tough time deciding what to read next. Sites like Goodreads or StoryGraph are very good but they always lacked for me in playfullness and features that'd be very useful. I.e random book picker which helps reduce the effects of the paradox of choice.  The website and illustrations will be fully designed by me (I really don't think that will change) and I am not a designer, BUT I want to test myself and maybe it will be fun!
